\title{Inspect design for dominant choice sets}
\usage{
cbc_inspect_dominance(x, priors, total_threshold = 0.8, exclude = NULL)

\method{cbc_inspect_dominance}{cbc_design}(x, priors, total_threshold = 0.8, exclude = NULL)

\method{cbc_inspect_dominance}{cbc_survey}(x, priors, total_threshold = 0.8, exclude = NULL)

\method{cbc_inspect_dominance}{data.frame}(x, priors, total_threshold = 0.8, exclude = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Either a \code{cbc_design} object created by \code{cbc_design()}, a \code{cbc_survey}
object, or a data frame containing a choice experiment design}

\item{priors}{A \code{cbc_priors} object created by \code{cbc_priors()} that will be
used to compute utilities. Required for dominance detection.}

\item{total_threshold}{Numeric threshold for total utility dominance detection.
If one alternative has a choice probability above this threshold, the choice
set is flagged. Default is 0.8.}

\item{exclude}{Character vector of attribute names to exclude from dominance
calculations}
}
\value{
The original design with two additional columns:
\itemize{
\item dominant_total: Logical indicating if choice set has total utility dominance
\item dominant_partial: Logical indicating if choice set has partial utility dominance
}
}
\description{
This function identifies choice sets where one alternative dominates others
either through high total utility or by having the best partial utility
across all attributes. Dominant choice sets provide little information
and may reduce the efficiency of the design.
}
\details{
Two types of dominance are detected:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Total utility dominance}: One alternative has a choice probability
above the threshold when all attributes are considered together
\item \strong{Partial utility dominance}: One alternative has the highest partial
utility for every single attribute (regardless of total utility)
}

Partial utility dominance can occur even when total utility dominance doesn't,
particularly when the dominant alternative isn't much better overall but is
consistently better across all attributes.

\examples{
# Create profiles with clear dominance potential
profiles <- cbc_profiles(
  price = c(10, 20, 30),
  quality = c("Low", "Medium", "High"),
  warranty = c(1, 2, 3)
)

# Create priors favoring lower price, higher quality, longer warranty
priors <- cbc_priors(
  profiles = profiles,
  price = -0.1,        # negative: prefer lower prices
  quality = c(0.5, 1.0), # prefer Medium and High over Low
  warranty = 0.3       # positive: prefer longer warranty
)

design <- cbc_design(profiles, n_alts = 3, n_q = 8, priors = priors)

# Inspect for dominance
design_flagged <- cbc_inspect_dominance(design, priors)

# Check results
table(design_flagged$dominant_total)
table(design_flagged$dominant_partial)
}
