\title{Create prior specifications for CBC models}
\usage{
cbc_priors(profiles, n_draws = 100, draw_type = "halton", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{profiles}{A data frame of profiles created by \code{cbc_profiles()}}

\item{n_draws}{Number of draws for DB-error calculation if using Bayesian
priors. Defaults to \code{100}}

\item{draw_type}{Specify the draw type as a character: \code{"halton"}
(the default) or \code{"sobol"} (recommended for models with more than 5
random parameters).}

\item{...}{Named arguments specifying priors for each attribute:
\itemize{
\item For fixed parameters:
\itemize{
\item Continuous variables: provide a single numeric value
\item Categorical variables: provide either:
\itemize{
\item An unnamed vector of values one less than the number of levels (dummy coding)
\item A named vector mapping levels to coefficients (remaining level becomes reference)
}
}
\item For random parameters: use \code{rand_spec()} to specify distribution, parameters, and correlations
}}
}
\value{
A structured prior specification object including parameter draws for
random coefficients
}
\description{
Creates a standardized prior specification object for use in CBC analysis
functions like \code{cbc_choices()} and \code{cbc_design()}. Supports both fixed and random
parameters, with flexible specification of categorical variable levels.

# Create profiles for an example conjoint about apples
profiles <- cbc_profiles(
  price     = c(1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3),
  type      = c("Fuji", "Gala", "Honeycrisp"),
  freshness = c("Poor", "Average", "Excellent")
)

# Example 1: Simple fixed parameters with unnamed vectors
priors <- cbc_priors(
  profiles = profiles,
  price = -0.5,
  type = c(0.2, 0.3),      # Dummy-coded categorical (Honeycrisp reference)
  freshness = c(0.4, 0.8)  # Dummy-coded categorical (Poor reference)
)

# Example 2: Using named vectors for categorical variables
priors <- cbc_priors(
  profiles = profiles,
  price = -0.5,
  type = c("Fuji" = 0.2, "Gala" = 0.3),  # Honeycrisp as reference
  freshness = c("Poor" = -0.4, "Average" = 0.1)  # Excellent as reference
)

# Example 3: Mixed fixed and random parameters
priors <- cbc_priors(
  profiles = profiles,
  price = -0.5,  # Fixed parameter
  type = rand_spec(  # Random parameter - normal distribution
    dist = "n",
    mean = c("Fuji" = 0.2, "Gala" = 0.3),  # Honeycrisp reference
    sd = c("Fuji" = 0.4, "Gala" = 0.4)
  ),
  freshness = c(0.4, 0.8)  # Fixed parameter
)

# Example 4: Log-normal distribution for price coefficient
priors <- cbc_priors(
  profiles = profiles,
  price = rand_spec(
    dist = "ln",    # Log-normal distribution for price
    mean = -0.5,    # Single value for continuous variable
    sd = 0.4
  ),
  type = c(0.2, 0.3),
  freshness = c(0.4, 0.8)
)

# Example 5: Random parameters with correlations
priors <- cbc_priors(
  profiles = profiles,
  price = rand_spec(
    dist = "ln",
    mean = -0.5,
    sd = 0.4,
    correlations = list(
      # Correlate with all type levels
      cor_spec(with = "type", value = 0.3),
      # Correlate with specific level
      cor_spec(with = "type", level = "Fuji", value = 0.4)
    )
  ),
  type = rand_spec(
    dist = "n",
    mean = c("Fuji" = 0.2, "Gala" = 0.3),
    sd = c("Fuji" = 0.4, "Gala" = 0.4),
    correlations = list(
      # Correlate between levels
      cor_spec(
        with = "type",
        level = "Fuji",
        with_level = "Gala",
