\title{Remove dominant choice sets from a design}
\usage{
cbc_remove_dominant(x, remove_total = TRUE, remove_partial = TRUE)

\method{cbc_remove_dominant}{cbc_design_flagged}(x, remove_total = TRUE, remove_partial = TRUE)

\method{cbc_remove_dominant}{cbc_design}(x, remove_total = TRUE, remove_partial = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A design object that has been processed by \code{cbc_inspect_dominance()}}

\item{remove_total}{Logical. Remove choice sets with total utility dominance?
Default is TRUE.}

\item{remove_partial}{Logical. Remove choice sets with partial utility dominance?
Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
The design with dominant choice sets removed
}
\description{
This function removes choice sets that have been flagged as dominant
by \code{cbc_inspect_dominance()}. Users can choose to remove sets with
total dominance, partial dominance, or both.
}
\examples{
# Following from cbc_inspect_dominance example
design_flagged <- cbc_inspect_dominance(design, priors)

# Remove all dominant choice sets
design_clean <- cbc_remove_dominant(design_flagged)

# Remove only total dominance, keep partial dominance
design_partial_ok <- cbc_remove_dominant(design_flagged,
                                        remove_total = TRUE,
                                        remove_partial = FALSE)
