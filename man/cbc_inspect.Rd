\title{Inspect design quality metrics}
\usage{
cbc_inspect(
  design,
  metrics = "all",
  verbose = FALSE,
  priors = NULL,
  total_threshold = 0.8,
  exclude = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{A \code{cbc_design} object created by \code{cbc_design()}}

\item{metrics}{Character vector specifying which metrics to inspect.
Options: "balance", "overlap", "dominance", or "all" (default).
Can specify multiple: \code{c("balance", "overlap")}}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, shows detailed technical metrics like
coefficient of variation. If FALSE (default), shows simplified output.}

\item{priors}{A \code{cbc_priors} object created by \code{cbc_priors()}. Required
for dominance inspection.}

\item{total_threshold}{Numeric threshold for total utility dominance detection.
Default is 0.8.}

\item{exclude}{Character vector of attribute names to exclude from calculations}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the inspection results, but primarily prints
formatted information to the console
}
\description{
This function provides comprehensive inspection of choice experiment designs
across multiple quality dimensions including attribute balance, overlap, and
dominance patterns.

\examples{
library(cbcTools)

# Create profiles and design
profiles <- cbc_profiles(
  price = c(1, 2, 3),
  type = c("A", "B", "C"),
  quality = c("Low", "High")
)

design <- cbc_design(
  profiles = profiles,
  n_alts = 2,
  n_q = 4
)

# Inspect all metrics (default, simple output)
cbc_inspect(design)

# Detailed output with technical metrics
cbc_inspect(design, verbose = TRUE)

# Inspect specific metrics
cbc_inspect(design, metrics = "balance")
cbc_inspect(design, metrics = c("balance", "overlap"))

# Inspect dominance (requires priors)
priors <- cbc_priors(
  profiles = profiles,
  price = -0.5,
  type = c(0.2, 0.3),
  quality = 0.4
)
cbc_inspect(design, metrics = "dominance", priors = priors)
