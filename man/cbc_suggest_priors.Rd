\usage{
cbc_suggest_priors(
  profiles,
  effect_size = c("moderate", "small", "large"),
  categorical_effect = NULL,
  direction = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{profiles}{A data frame of profiles created by \code{cbc_profiles()}}

\item{effect_size}{Character. Desired effect size: \code{"small"} (0.1-0.3),
\code{"moderate"} (0.3-1.0, default), or \code{"large"} (1.0-3.0). Controls the
utility range for continuous attributes.}

\item{categorical_effect}{Numeric. Effect size increment for categorical
levels. Defaults to \code{0.1} for small, \code{0.2} for moderate, and \code{0.5} for
large effect sizes. Categorical levels are spaced evenly from 0 to
\code{categorical_effect * (n_levels - 1)}.}

\item{direction}{Named list mapping attribute names to \code{"positive"} or
\code{"negative"} to specify the direction of the effect. Useful for attributes
like price where you expect a negative relationship. Defaults to \code{NULL}
(positive direction for all attributes).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a named list of suggested prior values. The function
primarily prints formatted output to the console.
}
\description{
Provides automated suggestions for prior specifications based on attribute
scales and desired effect sizes. This function analyzes your profile attributes
and generates starting values for priors that can be refined based on domain
knowledge.
}
\details{
This function analyzes each attribute in your profiles and suggests prior
parameter values scaled to produce the desired effect size. For continuous
attributes, coefficients are scaled so that the full attribute range produces
a utility contribution matching the target effect size. For categorical
attributes, levels are assigned evenly spaced coefficients with the first
level as the reference.

These suggestions are \strong{starting points} that should be refined based on:
\itemize{
\item Domain knowledge about attribute importance
\item Previous research or pilot studies
\item Expected relative importance between attributes
\item Sign considerations (e.g., negative coefficients for cost)
}

The function prints a formatted output with:
\itemize{
\item Copy-paste ready code for \code{cbc_priors()}
\item Explanation of suggested values
\item Expected utility ranges
\item Notes and recommendations
}

# Create example profiles

  freshness = c('Poor', 'Average', 'Excellent')

# Get moderate effect size suggestions (default)
cbc_suggest_priors(profiles)

# Get small effect size suggestions
cbc_suggest_priors(profiles, effect_size = "small")

# Get large effect size suggestions
cbc_suggest_priors(profiles, effect_size = "large")

# Specify direction for price (should be negative)
suggestions <- cbc_suggest_priors(
  profiles,
  effect_size = "moderate",
  direction = list(price = "negative")
)

# Use suggestions as a starting point
# Then adjust based on domain knowledge
priors <- cbc_priors(
  profiles,
  price = -0.5,  # Adjusted from suggestion
  type = c("Gala" = 0.3, "Honeycrisp" = 0.8),
  freshness = c("Average" = 0.4, "Excellent" = 0.9)
