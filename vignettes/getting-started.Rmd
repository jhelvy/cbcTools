cbcTools provides a complete toolkit for designing and analyzing choice-based conjoint (CBC) experiments. This article walks through the entire workflow from defining attributes to determining sample size requirements, providing a quick start guide for new users and an overview of the package's capabilities.

```{r}
library(cbcTools)
```

# The cbcTools Workflow

The package supports a step-by-step process for choice experiment design and analysis:

</center>

Each step uses functions that begin with `cbc_` and builds on the previous step:

1. **Generate Profiles** → `cbc_profiles()` - Define attributes and levels
2. **Create Priors** → `cbc_priors()` - Specify preference assumptions
3. **Generate Design** → `cbc_design()` - Create choice questions
4. **Inspect Design** → `cbc_inspect()` - Evaluate design quality
5. **Simulate Choices** → `cbc_choices()` - Generate realistic choice data
6. **Assess Power** → `cbc_power()` - Determine sample size requirements

Let's walk through each step with a complete example.

# Example: Apple Choice Experiment

Imagine we're designing a choice experiment to understand consumer preferences for apples. We want to study how **price**, **type**, and **freshness** influence purchase decisions.

## Step 1: Generate Profiles

Start by defining the attributes and levels for your experiment:

```{r}
# Define attributes and their levels
profiles <- cbc_profiles(
  price     = c(1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0),  # Price per pound ($)
  type      = c('Fuji', 'Gala', 'Honeycrisp'),
  freshness = c('Poor', 'Average', 'Excellent')
)

# View the profiles
head(profiles)
cat("Total profiles:", nrow(profiles))
```

This creates all possible combinations of attribute levels - our "universe" of possible products to include in choice questions.

### Optional: Apply Restrictions

If some combinations don't make sense, you can remove them:

```{r}
# Example: Remove unrealistic combinations
profiles_restricted <- cbc_restrict(
  profiles,
  # Premium apples (Honeycrisp) rarely sold at lowest prices
  type == "Honeycrisp" & price < 1.5
)

cat("Profiles after restrictions:", nrow(profiles_restricted))
```

For this example, we'll use the unrestricted profiles to keep things simple.

## Step 2: Create Priors

Specify your assumptions about consumer preferences based on theory, literature, or pilot studies:

```{r}
# Create prior assumptions about preferences
priors <- cbc_priors(
  profiles = profiles,
  price = -0.1,           # Negative = people prefer lower prices
  type = c(0.1, 0.2),     # Gala and Honeycrisp preferred over Fuji (reference)
  freshness = c(0.1, 0.2) # Average and Excellent preferred over Poor (reference)
)

# View the priors
priors
```

### Understanding Reference Levels

For categorical attributes, cbcTools uses **dummy coding**:
- **Type**: Fuji (reference), Gala (+0.1), Honeycrisp (+0.2)
- **Freshness**: Poor (reference), Average (+0.1), Excellent (+0.2)

This means Honeycrisp apples are most preferred, and Excellent freshness is most valued.

### Alternative: Random Parameters

For more realistic preference heterogeneity, use random parameters:

```{r}
# Priors with preference heterogeneity
priors_random <- cbc_priors(
  profiles = profiles,
  price = rand_spec(dist = "n", mean = -0.1, sd = 0.05),
  type = rand_spec(dist = "n", mean = c(0.1, 0.2), sd = c(0.05, 0.1)),
  freshness = c(0.1, 0.2)  # Keep some parameters fixed
)
```

## Step 3: Generate Design

Create the choice questions that respondents will see:

```{r}
# Create experimental design
design <- cbc_design(
  profiles = profiles,
  n_alts = 2,       # 2 alternatives per choice question
  n_q = 6,          # 6 questions per respondent
  n_resp = 300,     # 300 respondents
  priors = priors,  # Use our priors for optimization
  method = "stochastic"  # D-optimal design method
)

# View the design
head(design)
cat("Total choice observations:", nrow(design))
```

### Design Methods

cbcTools offers several design methods:

- **`"random"`**: Fast, good for large samples or exploratory studies
- **`"shortcut"`**: Frequency-balanced, good general-purpose method
- **`"stochastic"`**: D-optimal, best efficiency with good priors
- **`"modfed"`**: D-optimal, thorough optimization (slower)
- **`"cea"`**: D-optimal, attribute-by-attribute optimization

For most applications, `"stochastic"` provides a good balance of efficiency and speed.

## Step 4: Inspect Design

Evaluate the quality and properties of your design:

```{r}
# Comprehensive design inspection
inspection <- cbc_inspect(design)
print(inspection)
```

Key things to look for:
- **D-error**: Lower values indicate more efficient designs
- **Balance**: Higher scores indicate better attribute level balance
- **Overlap**: Lower scores indicate less attribute overlap within questions
- **Profile usage**: Higher percentages indicate better use of available profiles

## Step 5: Simulate Choices

Generate realistic choice data to test your design:

```{r}
# Simulate choices using our priors
choices <- cbc_choices(design, priors = priors)

# View simulated choice data
head(choices)

# Check choice patterns
chosen_profiles <- choices[choices$choice == 1, ]
cat("Average price chosen:", round(mean(chosen_profiles$price), 2), "\n")
cat("Honeycrisp choice rate:", round(mean(chosen_profiles$typeHoneycrisp), 2), "\n")
cat("Excellent freshness rate:", round(mean(chosen_profiles$freshnessExcellent), 2), "\n")
```

The choice patterns should align with your priors - lower prices, preferred apple types, and better freshness should be chosen more often.

## Step 6: Assess Power

Determine if your sample size provides adequate statistical power:

```{r}
# Conduct power analysis
power <- cbc_power(choices)
power
```

### Visualize Power

```{r}
# Plot power curves
plot(power, type = "power", power_threshold = 0.8)
```

### Sample Size Requirements

```{r}
# Determine sample size for 80% power
summary(power, power_threshold = 0.8)
```

Based on these results, you can determine whether 300 respondents is adequate or if you need a larger sample.

# Complete Workflow Example

Here's the entire workflow in a single code block that you can adapt for your own studies:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Complete cbcTools workflow
library(cbcTools)

# 1. Generate profiles
profiles <- cbc_profiles(
  price = c(1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0),
  type = c('Fuji', 'Gala', 'Honeycrisp'),
  freshness = c('Poor', 'Average', 'Excellent')
)

# 2. Create priors
priors <- cbc_priors(
  profiles = profiles,
  price = -0.1,
  type = c(0.1, 0.2),
  freshness = c(0.1, 0.2)
)

# 3. Generate design
design <- cbc_design(
  profiles = profiles,
  n_alts = 2,
  n_q = 6,
  n_resp = 300,
  priors = priors,
  method = "stochastic"
)

# 4. Inspect design
cbc_inspect(design)

# 5. Simulate choices
choices <- cbc_choices(design, priors = priors)

# 6. Assess power
power <- cbc_power(choices)

# Visualize results
plot(power)
summary(power, power_threshold = 0.8)
```

# Using the Pipe Operator

For a streamlined workflow, you can pipe the functions together:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Streamlined workflow using pipes
cbc_profiles(
  price = c(1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0),
  type = c('Fuji', 'Gala', 'Honeycrisp'),
  freshness = c('Poor', 'Average', 'Excellent')
) |>
cbc_design(
  n_alts = 2,
  n_q = 6,
  n_resp = 300,
  priors = priors,
  method = "stochastic"
) |>
cbc_choices(priors = priors) |>
cbc_power() |>
plot()
```

# Common Design Features

## No-Choice Option

Add a "no-choice" alternative for more realistic choice scenarios:

```{r}
# Design with no-choice option
priors_nochoice <- cbc_priors(
  profiles = profiles,
  price = -0.1,
  type = c(0.1, 0.2),
  freshness = c(0.1, 0.2),
  no_choice = -0.5  # Utility of choosing neither alternative
)

design_nochoice <- cbc_design(
  profiles = profiles,
  n_alts = 2,
  n_q = 6,
  n_resp = 300,
  no_choice = TRUE,
  priors = priors_nochoice,
  method = "stochastic"
)

head(design_nochoice)
```

## Labeled Designs

Create alternative-specific designs where one attribute serves as a label:

```{r}
# Labeled design using apple type as labels
design_labeled <- cbc_design(
  profiles = profiles,
  n_alts = 3,
  n_q = 6,
  n_resp = 300,
  label = "type",  # Each alternative shows a different apple type
  method = "random"
)

head(design_labeled)
```

## Blocking

For large designs, use blocks to reduce respondent burden:

```{r}
# Blocked design
design_blocked <- cbc_design(
  profiles = profiles,
  n_alts = 2,
  n_q = 8,         # More questions per block
  n_resp = 400,
  n_blocks = 4,    # Divide into 4 blocks
  priors = priors,
  method = "stochastic"
)

# Check block allocation
table(design_blocked$blockID)
```

# Comparing Different Approaches

Compare multiple design strategies:

```{r}
# Create different designs
design_random <- cbc_design(profiles, n_alts = 2, n_q = 6, n_resp = 200, method = "random")
design_shortcut <- cbc_design(profiles, n_alts = 2, n_q = 6, n_resp = 200, method = "shortcut")
design_optimal <- cbc_design(profiles, n_alts = 2, n_q = 6, n_resp = 200,
                            priors = priors, method = "stochastic")

# Compare design efficiency
comparison <- cbc_compare(
  Random = design_random,
  Shortcut = design_shortcut,
  Optimal = design_optimal,
  sort_by = "d_error"
)

print(comparison)
```

# Best Practices

## Starting Your Study

1. **Literature review**: Research similar studies for realistic priors
2. **Pilot testing**: Run small pilots to validate assumptions
3. **Conservative planning**: Use pessimistic priors for sample size planning
4. **Design comparison**: Test multiple design methods
5. **Document assumptions**: Record all choices for reproducibility

## Common Decisions

### How many alternatives per question?
- **2 alternatives**: Easier for respondents, requires more questions
- **3-4 alternatives**: More realistic, more efficient, harder cognitively
- **5+ alternatives**: Avoid - cognitive overload

### How many questions per respondent?
- **4-8 questions**: Good balance of information and respondent burden
- **10+ questions**: Risk of fatigue effects
- **<4 questions**: May not provide enough information per respondent

### What sample size?
- **Pilot studies**: 50-150 respondents
- **Academic research**: 200-800 respondents
- **Commercial research**: 300-1000+ respondents
- Use power analysis to determine specific needs

## Quality Checks

Always verify your design:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Check design quality
cbc_inspect(design, sections = "all")

# Validate choice simulation
choices <- cbc_choices(design, priors = priors)
summary(choices[choices$choice == 1, ])

# Confirm adequate power
power_results <- cbc_power(choices, pars = c("price", "type", "freshness"))
summary(power_results, power_threshold = 0.8)
```

# Next Steps

## Data Collection

After finalizing your design:

1. **Program survey**: Implement design in survey software
2. **Pretest**: Run small pretest with real respondents
3. **Launch study**: Collect data with planned sample size
4. **Monitor quality**: Check for satisficing, speeders, etc.

## Data Analysis

Analyze collected data using choice modeling:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Example analysis with logitr package
library(logitr)

# Estimate multinomial logit model
model <- logitr(
  data = your_collected_data,
  outcome = "choice",
  obsID = "obsID",
  pars = c("price", "type", "freshness")
)

summary(model)
```
