## All profiles 

The first step in designing an experiment is to define the attributes and levels for your experiment and then generate all of the `profiles` of each possible combination of those attributes and levels. For example, let's say you're designing a conjoint experiment about apples and you want to include `price`, `type`, and `freshness` as attributes. You can obtain all of the possible profiles for these attributes using the `cbc_profiles()` function:

```{r}
library(cbcTools)

profiles <- cbc_profiles(
  price     = seq(1, 5, 0.5), # $ per pound
  type      = c('Fuji', 'Gala', 'Honeycrisp'),
  freshness = c('Poor', 'Average', 'Excellent')
)

nrow(profiles)
head(profiles)
tail(profiles)
```

## Restricted profiles 

Depending on the context of your survey, you may wish to eliminate some profiles before designing your conjoint survey (e.g., some profile combinations may be illogical or unrealistic). 

> **CAUTION: including restrictions in your designs can substantially reduce the statistical power of your design, so use them cautiously and avoid them if possible**.

If you do wish to restrict some attribute level combinations, you can do so using the `cbc_restrict()` function, which takes the full set of `profiles` along with any number of restricted pairs of attribute levels, defined as pairs of logical expressions separated by commas. In the example below, I include the following restrictions (these are arbitrary and just for illustration purposes):

- `"Gala"` apples will not be shown with the prices `1.5`, `2.5`, and `3.5`.
- `"Honeycrisp"` apples will not be shown with prices less than `2`.
- `"Fuji"` apples will not be shown with the `"Excellent"` freshness.

With these restrictions, there are now only 57 profiles compared to 81 without them:

```{r}
restricted_profiles <- cbc_restrict(
    profiles,
    type == "Gala" & price %in% c(1.5, 2.5, 3.5),
    type == "Honeycrisp" & price < 2,
    type == "Fuji" & freshness == "Excellent"
)

dim(restricted_profiles)
```
