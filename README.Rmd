## Installation

The current version is not yet on CRAN, but you can install it from
Github using the {remotes} library:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jhelvy/cbcTools")
```

Load the library with:

```{r}
library(cbcTools)
```

## Make survey designs

### Generating profiles

The first step in designing an experiment is to define the attributes and levels for your experiment and then generate all of the `profiles` of each possible combination of those attributes and levels. For example, let's say you're designing a conjoint experiment about apples and you want to include `price`, `type`, and `freshness` as attributes. You can obtain all of the possible profiles for these attributes using the `cbc_profiles()` function:

```{r}
profiles <- cbc_profiles(
  price     = seq(1, 4, 0.5), # $ per pound
  type      = c('Fuji', 'Gala', 'Honeycrisp'),
  freshness = c('Poor', 'Average', 'Excellent')
)

nrow(profiles)
head(profiles)
tail(profiles)
```

Depending on the context of your survey, you may wish to eliminate or modify some profiles before designing your conjoint survey (e.g., some profile combinations may be illogical or unrealistic). **WARNING: including hard constraints in your designs can substantially reduce the statistical power of your design, so use them cautiously and avoid them if possible**.

If you do wish to set some levels conditional on those of other attributes, you can do so by setting each level of an attribute to a list that defines these constraints. In the example below, the `type` attribute has constraints such that only certain price levels will be shown for each level. In addition, for the `"Honeycrisp"` level, only two of the three `freshness` levels are included: `"Excellent"` and `"Average"`. Note that both the other attributes (`price` and `freshness`) should contain all of the possible levels. When these constraints you can see that there are only 30 profiles compared to 63 without constraints:

```{r}
profiles <- cbc_profiles(
  price = c(1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5),
  freshness = c('Poor', 'Average', 'Excellent'),
  type = list(
    "Fuji" = list(
        price = c(2, 2.5, 3)
    ),
    "Gala" = list(
        price = c(1, 1.5, 2)
    ),
    "Honeycrisp" = list(
        price = c(2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5),
        freshness = c("Average", "Excellent")
    )
  )
)

nrow(profiles)
head(profiles)
tail(profiles)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
profiles <- cbc_profiles(
  price     = seq(1, 4, 0.5), # $ per pound
  type      = c('Fuji', 'Gala', 'Honeycrisp'),
  freshness = c('Poor', 'Average', 'Excellent')
)
```

### Generating random designs

Once a set of profiles is obtained, a randomized conjoint survey can then be generated using the `cbc_design()` function:

```{r}
design <- cbc_design(
  profiles = profiles,
  n_resp   = 900, # Number of respondents
  n_alts   = 3,   # Number of alternatives per question
  n_q      = 6    # Number of questions per respondent
)

dim(design)  # View dimensions
head(design) # Preview first 6 rows
```

For now, the `cbc_design()` function only generates a randomized design. Other packages, such as the [{idefix}](https://github.com/traets/idefix) package, are able to generate other types of designs, such as Bayesian D-efficient designs. The randomized design simply samples from the set of `profiles`. It also ensures that no two profiles are the same in any choice question.

The resulting `design` data frame includes the following columns:

- `respID`: Identifies each survey respondent.
- `qID`: Identifies the choice question answered by the respondent.
- `altID`:Identifies the alternative in any one choice observation.
- `obsID`: Identifies each unique choice observation across all respondents.
- `profileID`: Identifies the profile in `profiles`.

### Labeled designs (a.k.a. "alternative-specific" designs)

You can also make a "labeled" design (also known as "alternative-specific" design) where the levels of one attribute is used as a label by setting the `label` argument to that attribute. This by definition sets the number of alternatives in each question to the number of levels in the chosen attribute, so the `n_alts` argument is overridden. Here is an example labeled survey using the `type` attribute as the label:

```{r}
design_labeled <- cbc_design(
  profiles  = profiles,
  n_resp    = 900, # Number of respondents
  n_alts    = 3,   # Number of alternatives per question
  n_q       = 6,   # Number of questions per respondent
  label     = "type" # Set the "type" attribute as the label
)

dim(design_labeled)
head(design_labeled)
```

In the above example, you can see in the first six rows of the survey that the `type` attribute is always fixed to be the same order, ensuring that each level in the `type` attribute will always be shown in each choice question.

### Adding a "no choice" option (a.k.a. "outside good")

You can include a "no choice" (also known as "outside good" option in your survey by setting `no_choice = TRUE`. If included, all categorical attributes will be dummy-coded to appropriately dummy-code the "no choice" alternative.

```{r}
design_nochoice <- cbc_design(
  profiles  = profiles,
  n_resp    = 900, # Number of respondents
  n_alts    = 3, # Number of alternatives per question
  n_q       = 6, # Number of questions per respondent
  no_choice = TRUE
)

dim(design_nochoice)
head(design_nochoice)
```

## Inspecting survey designs

The package includes some functions to quickly inspect some basic metrics of a design.

The `cbc_balance()` function prints out a summary of the counts of each level for each attribute across all choice questions as well as the two-way counts across all pairs of attributes for a given design:

```{r}
cbc_balance(design)
```

The `cbc_overlap()` function prints out a summary of the amount of "overlap" across attributes within the choice questions. For example, for each attribute, the count under `"1"` is the number of choice questions in which the same level was shown across all alternatives for that attribute (because there was only one level shown). Likewise, the count under `"2"` is the number of choice questions in which only two unique levels of that attribute were shown, and so on:

```{r}
cbc_overlap(design)
```

## Simulating choices

You can simulate choices for a given `design` using the `cbc_choices()` function. By default, random choices are simulated:

```{r}
data <- cbc_choices(
  design = design,
  obsID  = "obsID"
)

head(data)
```

You can also pass a list of prior parameters to define a utility model that will be used to simulate choices. In the example below, the choices are simulated using a utility model with the following parameters:

- 1 continuous parameter for `price`
- 2 categorical parameters for `type` (`'Gala'` and `'Honeycrisp'`)
- 2 categorical parameters for `freshness` (`"Average"` and `"Excellent"`)

Note that for categorical variables (`type` and `freshness` in this example), the first level defined when using `cbc_profiles()` is set as the reference level. The example below defines the following utility model for simulating choices for each alternative _j_:

$$
u_j = 0.1price_j + 0.1typeGala_j + 0.2typeHoneycrisp_j + 0.1freshnessAverage_j + 0.2freshnessExcellent_j + \varepsilon_j
$$

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data <- cbc_choices(
  design = design,
  obsID = "obsID",
  priors = list(
    price     = 0.1,
    type      = c(0.1, 0.2),
    freshness = c(0.1, 0.2)
  )
)
```

If you wish to include a prior model with an interaction, you can do so inside the `priors` list. For example, here is the same example as above but with an interaction between `price` and `type` added:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data <- cbc_choices(
  design = design,
  obsID = "obsID",
  priors = list(
    price = 0.1,
    type = c(0.1, 0.2),
    freshness = c(0.1, 0.2),
    `price*type` = c(0.1, 0.5)
  )
)
```

Finally, you can also simulate data for a mixed logit model where parameters follow a normal or log-normal distribution across the population. In the example below, the `randN()` function is used to specify the `type` attribute with 2 random normal parameters with a specified vector of means (`mean`) and standard deviations (`sd`) for each level of `type`. Log-normal parameters are specified using `randLN()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data <- cbc_choices(
  design = design,
  obsID = "obsID",
  priors = list(
    price = 0.1,
    type = randN(mean = c(0.1, 0.2), sd = c(1, 2)),
    freshness = c(0.1, 0.2)
  )
)
```

## Conducting a power analysis

The simulated choice data can be used to conduct a power analysis by estimating the same model multiple times with incrementally increasing sample sizes. As the sample size increases, the estimated coefficient standard errors will decrease (i.e. coefficient estimates become more precise). The `cbc_power()` function achieves this by partitioning the choice data into multiple sizes (defined by the `nbreaks` argument) and then estimating a user-defined choice model on each data subset. In the example below, 10 different sample sizes are used. All models are estimated using the [{logitr}](https://jhelvy.github.io/logitr) package:

```{r}
power <- cbc_power(
  data    = data,
  pars    = c("price", "type", "freshness"),
  outcome = "choice",
  obsID   = "obsID",
  nbreaks = 10,
  n_q     = 6
)

head(power)
tail(power)
```

The `power` data frame contains the coefficient estimates and standard errors for each sample size. You can quickly visualize the outcome to identify a required sample size for a desired level of parameter precision by using the `plot()` method:

```{r power}
plot(power)
```

If you want to examine any other aspects of the models other than the standard errors, you can set `return_models = TRUE` and `cbc_power()` will return a list of estimated models. The example below prints a summary of the last model in the list of models:

```{r}
library(logitr)

models <- cbc_power(
  data    = data,
  pars    = c("price", "type", "freshness"),
  outcome = "choice",
  obsID   = "obsID",
  nbreaks = 10,
  n_q     = 6,
  return_models = TRUE
)

summary(models[[10]])
```

## Piping it all together!

One of the convenient features of how the package is written is that the object generated in each step is used as the first argument to the function for the next step. Thus, just like in the overall program diagram, the functions can be piped together:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
cbc_profiles(
  price     = seq(1, 4, 0.5), # $ per pound
  type      = c('Fuji', 'Gala', 'Honeycrisp'),
  freshness = c('Poor', 'Average', 'Excellent')
) |>
cbc_design(
  n_resp   = 900, # Number of respondents
  n_alts   = 3,   # Number of alternatives per question
  n_q      = 6    # Number of questions per respondent
) |>
cbc_choices(
  obsID = "obsID",
  priors = list(
    price     = 0.1,
    type      = c(0.1, 0.2),
    freshness = c(0.1, 0.2)
  )
) |>
cbc_power(
    pars    = c("price", "type", "freshness"),
    outcome = "choice",
    obsID   = "obsID",
    nbreaks = 10,
    n_q     = 6
) |>
plot()
```

```{r, ref.label='power', echo=FALSE}
```
