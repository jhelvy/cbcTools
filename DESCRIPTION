Description: Design and evaluate choice-based conjoint survey experiments. Generate a variety of survey designs, including random designs, full factorial designs, orthogonal designs, D-optimal designs, and Bayesian D-efficient designs as well as designs with "no choice" options and "labeled" (also known as "alternative specific") designs. Conveniently inspect the design balance and overlap, and simulate choice data for a survey design either randomly or according to a multinomial or mixed logit utility model defined by user-provided prior parameters. Conduct a power analysis for a given survey design by estimating the same model on different subsets of the data to simulate different sample sizes. Bayesian D-efficient designs are obtained using the 'idefix' package (Traets et al, 2020) <doi:10.18637/jss.v096.i03>. Choice simulation and model estimation in power analyses are handled using the 'logitr' package (Helveston, 2023) <doi:10.18637/jss.v105.i10>.
