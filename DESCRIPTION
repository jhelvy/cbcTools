Description: Tools for designing surveys and conducting power analyses for choice-based conjoint survey experiments in R. Users can generate a design of experiment and use it to create a survey data frame. Choice data for the survey can be simulated either randomly or according to a multinomial or mixed logit utility model defined by user-provided parameters. Power analyses can be conducted on the survey design by estimating the same model multiple times using different subsets of the data to simulate different sample sizes.
