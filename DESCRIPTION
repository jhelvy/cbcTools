Description: Design and evaluate choice-based conjoint survey experiments. Generate a variety of survey designs, including random designs, frequency-based designs, and D-optimal designs, as well as "labeled" designs (also known as "alternative-specific designs"), designs with "no choice" options, and designs with dominant alternatives removed. Conveniently inspect and compare designs using a variety of metrics, including design balance, overlap, and D-error, and simulate choice data for a survey design either randomly or according to a utility model defined by user-provided prior parameters. Conduct a power analysis for a given survey design by estimating the same model on different subsets of the data to simulate different sample sizes. Bayesian D-efficient designs using the 'cea' and 'modfed' methods are obtained using the 'idefix' package by Traets et al (2020) <doi:10.18637/jss.v096.i03>. Choice simulation and model estimation in power analyses are handled using the 'logitr' package by Helveston (2023) <doi:10.18637/jss.v105.i10>.
