Description: Tools for designing surveys and conducting power analyses for choice-based conjoint survey experiments in R. Users can generate survey designs, including randomized designs and Bayesian D-efficient designs as well as designs with "no choice" options and labeled designs. Design balance and overlap can be conveniently inspected. Choice data for the survey design can be simulated either randomly or according to a multinomial or mixed logit utility model defined by user-provided prior parameters. Power analyses can be conducted on the survey design by estimating the same model multiple times using different subsets of the data to simulate different sample sizes.
